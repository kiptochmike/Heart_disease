    "## 1. **BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING**\n",
    "\n",
    "### a. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Heart disease, particularly coronary artery disease (CAD), is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Early detection and accurate diagnosis are crucial for effective treatment and prevention of severe outcomes. Machine learning has the potential to significantly enhance the predictive accuracy for CAD, offering a powerful tool for healthcare providers. This project aims to leverage a comprehensive heart disease dataset, created by combining five well-known datasets, to develop a predictive model for CAD.\n",
    "\n",
    "### b. Problem Statement\n",
    "### **What is the prevailing Circumstance?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite advances in medical technology, the early detection and diagnosis of coronary artery disease remain challenging. Traditional diagnostic methods can be time-consuming, costly, and may not always be accurate.\n",
    "### **What problem is being addressed?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The project addresses the challenge of improving the early and accurate prediction of coronary artery disease. Current diagnostic methods can be supplemented by a predictive model to provide timely and reliable insights, which are essential for early intervention and better patient outcomes.\n",
    "### **How the project aims to solve the problems?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The project aims to develop a machine learning model using a combined dataset from five established heart disease datasets. By training the model on a large and diverse dataset with 11 common features, the predictive accuracy can be enhanced. The model will help healthcare providers in identifying high-risk patients, thereby facilitating early diagnosis and personalized treatment plans.\n",
    "\n",
    "### c. Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Main Objectives\n",
    "- To develop a machine learning model that can predict the presence of coronary artery disease based on patient data.\n",
    "#### Specific Objectives\n",
    "- To clean and preprocess the combined heart disease dataset ensuring data quality and consistency.\n",
    "- To select and engineer features that significantly contribute to the prediction of CAD.\n",
    "- To train and validate multiple machine learning models to identify the most accurate and interpretable model.\n",
    "- To implement the model in a user-friendly interface for healthcare providers.\n",
